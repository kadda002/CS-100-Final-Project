   Our project will be focused on coding a machine designed to construct pizzas based on user selection. 
   Customers can select the type of size and toppings on the pizza while the cheese and sauces will already 
   be set based on the type of pizza the user chooses to start with. The interesting factor of this 
   application is the technological advancements in different types of industries and the creation of different 
   types of experiences that consumers have in how they order food and how consumers customize them. All the 
   selections for pizzas mentioned above as well as payment options will count as the inputs asked by the user 
   (which cannot be changed unless the user starts over) while the full description of the food and itâ€™s cost for 
   each selection will be the output.

   The code for the project will be in C++ using Linux as the source for typing all code and sending them to Github 
   where all our classes can be merged. Mahdi will be focusing on Composite Design Patterns, Krishna will use Abstract 
   Factory Design Patterns, and Zach is going to implement Decorator Design Patterns.
