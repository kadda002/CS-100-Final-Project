    Our project will be focused on coding a machine designed to construct pizzas based on selections inputted from the user. Customers can select what type of dough, sauce, 
    cheese, and toppings go on the pizza as well as how they want it prepared, both size and cooked. The interesting factor of this application is the technological advancements 
    in different types of industries and the creation of different types of experiences consumers have in how they order foods and how consumers customize them. All the selections 
    for pizzas mentioned above will count as the inputs asked by the user (which cannot be changed unless the user starts over) while the full description of the food and itâ€™s 
    cost for each selection will be the output.

    The code for the project will be in C++ and/or Python using Linux as the source for typing all code and sending them to Github where all our classes can be merged. Mahdi will 
    be focusing on Composite Design Patterns, Krishna will use Abstract Factory Design Patterns, and Zach is going to implement Decorator Design Patterns.
